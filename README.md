# KisanSeva

Kisan Seva is an IoT-based application that is useful for farmers. Using this application, farmers can get the current temperature and humidity details.

**The problem KisanSeva solves**

Farmers have tremendous importance in our society, and it is due to them
that we can fulfill our basic needs of food. Many times, due to poor or
negligent monitoring of soil health, they tend to face many losses due to a
drop in the quality of their crops. To minimize the laborious work on their end,
build an agricultural monitoring website/application. This will help the
farmers make informed decisions while farming and increase product yield
while maintaining the standard.
The website/application should be intuitive and easy to use with the
requirements in mind and should consider the cost and complexity of the IoT
components involved for ease in deployment over multiple regions.

**Technologies we used**
Firebase, Raspberry Pi, Internet of Things (IoT), DartFlutter
